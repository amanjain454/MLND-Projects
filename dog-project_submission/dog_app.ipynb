You must create your CNN _from scratch_ (so, you can't use transfer learning _yet_!), and you must attain a test accuracy of at least 1%.  In Step 5 of this notebook, you will have the opportunity to use transfer learning to create a CNN that attains greatly improved accuracy.\n",

    "Convolution layers capture the neighbour of an element. So near by pixels get togeter to explain overall features. In the 1st Convolution layers algorithm obtains the the low level features like edges etc. For the 2nd conv layer, the input is the feature map from the first layer. So each layer of the input is basically describing the locations of low level features in the original image. Now when you apply a set of filters on top of that (pass it through the 2nd conv layer), the output will be activations that represent higher level features. So, two edges can come together to represent an square etc. Other high level patters semicircles or triangles starts emerging. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you go through the network and go through more conv layers, you get activation maps that represent more and more complex features and an image eventually. For a colored image, CNN are easily scalable by breaking down images into 3-D vectors (from RGB). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "High Level Summary: \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of having multiple layers of CNN was to extract the features from the images. To do this, the filters were halfed in each conv layer. There are max pooling layers between them to reduce the size. There were also dropout layers to prevent overfitting and ensure sufficient learning. A relu function was used in the dense layer, and then, for the output, a softmax since it's the best for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detailed Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sequential model is used. it is basically linear stack of multiple layers. We can create a Sequential model by defining list of layer instances. \n",
    "\n",
    "Convolution layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first layer in a CNN is always a Convolutional Layer. The model needs to be told expected size of input in first layer. Other layers in the model can infer size from the previous layers and other parameters (like striding etc.) Hence, a an input_shape tuple argument input_shape=((224, 224, 3)) is passed to the first layer. \n",
    "Convolution layer puts in filters (here we are using 2*2 filter - please see below section for explanaiton for filter size) to extract features from an image. Convolution layer (after multiplying with filter) deploys a activation functions to create a feature map.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Pooling layers:\n",
    "Pooling layers are used in tandem to convolution layers to to reduce variance and to reduce computation complexity. At the same time it and extract low level features from neighbourhood. \n",
    "\n",
    "3 set of Conolution and Pooling: \n",
    "\n",
    "First convolution layer determines the high level featues like edges and curves. To obtian high level features like eyes, body shape, nose we need to go deeper. However, if we go too deep information will become too dilute for network to train. Hence a depth of 3 is taken for the convolution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dropout layers \n",
    "Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored randomly during training. This means that their contribution to the activation of downstream neurons is temporally removed on the forward pass and any weight updates are not applied to the neuron on the backward pass. This is important to avoid overfitting and provide an opportunity to the lower weights nodes to contribute. \n",
    "\n",
    "Flatten layer\n",
    "If we need to do classification, we would need to use dense layer as last layer. Fully connected layers can not take any (spatial or otherwise) into account for processing. Output of a CNN is a 3-D array preserving spatial information (nearby pixels preserves spatial informaiton). so we treat output of the last convolution layers as a large piece of unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dense layer\n",
    "2 dense layers are used - with a dropout layer in between these. In a dense layer, every node in the layer is connected to every node in the preceding layer - hence fully connected. Size of Last dense layer is equal to the number of classes (133 dog breeds in this case). Size reduction (from flatter layer to 133) is done is two steps to preserve information. Last dense layer used softmax activation to help produce a probabilistic distribution among candidate clsses (breeds). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Other key decisions for the parameters: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Activation method: \n",
    "\n",
    "Rectified linear units (\"ReLU\") activation method is used for all, but the last layer. One major benefit of using \"RELU\" is the reduced likelihood of the gradient to vanish unlike in the sigmoid function where gradient reduces to very small number as absolute value of x increases. The other benefit of ReLUs is sparsity. Sparsity arises when a≤0. The more such units that exist in a layer the more sparse the resulting representation. Sigmoids on the other hand are always likely to dense representations. Sparse representations seem to be more scalable and beneficial than dense representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last layer of a CNN model is generally a softmax activation layer. The ReLUs will not vanish the effect during your training process. However, when you want to deal with classification problems, they cannot help much. Simply speaking, the sigmoid function or (\"ReLU\") can only handle two classes, which is not what we expect (dog breeds are much more than two). \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Pooling method to use? pool size?\n",
    "Max pooling extracts the most important features like edges whereas, average pooling extracts features so smoothly. For image data - I think max pooling is better for extracting the extreme features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pool size of 2*2 pooling reduces 75% data. A higher pooling size we run risk of loosing information. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Nnumber of Conv2D layers\n",
    "why 3 number?\n",
    "Be careful with adding too many trainable layers! More parameters means longer training, which means you are more likely to need a GPU to accelerate the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Kernal / filter size \n",
    "Its a trade off between speed and accuracy. For the given model, with filter size of 2*2 for all layers, model training time for each epoch was around 9-10 minutes (ETA: 550-560 seconds). This is not a large time that warrants a a negotiation for the accuracy - hence i decided to keep filter size at 2*2.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Drop out probability\n",
