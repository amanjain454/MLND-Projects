    "In this project, you will work towards constructing an optimized Q-Learning driving agent that will navigate a *Smartcab* through its environment towards a goal. Since the *Smartcab* is expected to drive passengers from one location to another, the driving agent will be evaluated on two very important metrics: **Safety** and **Reliability**. A driving agent that gets the *Smartcab* to its destination while running red lights or narrowly avoiding accidents would be considered **unsafe**. Similarly, a driving agent that frequently fails to reach the destination in time would be considered **unreliable**. Maximizing the driving agent's **safety** and **reliability** would ensure that *Smartcabs* have a permanent place in the transportation industry.\n",

    "|   A   \t|  Agent commits few minor traffic violations,<br/>such as failing to move on a green light. | Agent reaches the destination on time<br />for at least 90% of trips. |\n",
    "|   B   \t| Agent commits frequent minor traffic violations,<br/>such as failing to move on a green light. | Agent reaches the destination on time<br />for at least 80% of trips. |\n",
    "|   C   \t|  Agent commits at least one major traffic violation,<br/> such as driving through a red light. | Agent reaches the destination on time<br />for at least 70% of trips. |\n",
    "|   D   \t| Agent causes at least one minor accident,<br/> such as turning left on green with oncoming traffic.       \t| Agent reaches the destination on time<br />for at least 60% of trips. |\n",

    "## Improve the Q-Learning Driving Agent\n",
    "The third step to creating an optimized Q-Learning agent is to perform the optimization! Now that the Q-Learning algorithm is implemented and the driving agent is successfully learning, it's necessary to tune settings and adjust learning paramaters so the driving agent learns both **safety** and **efficiency**. Typically this step will require a lot of trial and error, as some settings will invariably make the learning worse. One thing to keep in mind is the act of learning itself and the time that this takes: In theory, we could allow the agent to learn for an incredibly long amount of time; however, another goal of Q-Learning is to *transition from experimenting with unlearned behavior to acting on learned behavior*. For example, always allowing the agent to perform a random action during training (if $\\epsilon = 1$ and never decays) will certainly make it *learn*, but never let it *act*. When improving on your Q-Learning implementation, consider the implications it creates and whether it is logistically sensible to make a particular adjustment."

    "- `'enforce_deadline'` - Set this to `True` to force the driving agent to capture whether it reaches the destination in time.\n",
    "- `'update_delay'` - Set this to a small value (such as `0.01`) to reduce the time between steps in each trial.\n",
    "- `'log_metrics'` - Set this to `True` to log the simluation results as a `.csv` file and the Q-table as a `.txt` file in `/logs/`.\n",

    "\n",
    "Additional flags that can be adjusted as part of optimizing the Q-Learning agent:\n",
    "- `'n_test'` - Set this to some positive number (previously 10) to perform that many testing trials.\n",
    "- `'alpha'` - Set this to a real number between 0 - 1 to adjust the learning rate of the Q-Learning algorithm.\n",
    "- `'epsilon'` - Set this to a real number between 0 - 1 to adjust the starting exploration factor of the Q-Learning algorithm.\n",
    "- `'tolerance'` - set this to some small value larger than 0 (default was 0.05) to set the epsilon threshold for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, use a decaying function of your choice for $\\epsilon$ (the exploration factor). Note that whichever function you use, it **must decay to **`'tolerance'`** at a reasonable rate**. The Q-Learning agent will not begin testing until this occurs. Some example decaying functions (for $t$, the number of trials):\n",

    "If you have difficulty getting your implementation to work, try setting the `'verbose'` flag to `True` to help debug.

    "\n",
    "Sometimes, the answer to the important question *\"what am I trying to get my agent to learn?\"* only has a theoretical answer and cannot be concretely described. Here, however, you can concretely define what it is the agent is trying to learn, and that is the U.S. right-of-way traffic laws. Since these laws are known information, you can further define, for each state the *Smartcab* is occupying, the optimal action for the driving agent based on these laws. In that case, we call the set of optimal state-action pairs an **optimal policy**. Hence, unlike some theoretical answers, it is clear whether the agent is acting \"incorrectly\" not only by the reward (penalty) it receives, but also by pure observation. If the agent drives through a red light, we both see it receive a negative reward but also know that it is not the correct behavior. This can be used to your advantage for verifying whether the **policy** your driving agent has learned is the correct one, or if it is a **suboptimal policy**."

    "### Optional: Future Rewards - Discount Factor, `'gamma'`\n",
    "Curiously, as part of the Q-Learning algorithm, you were asked to **not** use the discount factor, `'gamma'` in the implementation. Including future rewards in the algorithm is used to aid in propagating positive rewards backwards from a future state to the current state. Essentially, if the driving agent is given the option to make several actions to arrive at different states, including future rewards will bias the agent towards states that could provide even more rewards. An example of this would be the driving agent moving towards a goal: With all actions and rewards equal, moving towards the goal would theoretically yield better rewards if there is an additional reward for reaching the goal. However, even though in this project, the driving agent is trying to reach a destination in the allotted time, including future rewards will not benefit the agent. In fact, if the agent were given many trials to learn, it could negatively affect Q-values!"
